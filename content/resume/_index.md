<ul> <li style="list-style-type: none">
Worked with F500 companies to achieve their outcomes and successfully transform the way they build software by building and running cloud-native applications.
<br>
<br>
*Modernize Applications* - Transformed customers legacy application portfolio to a cloud-native portfolio. Thusly incrementally reducing time, cost, and operational inefficiencies while maintaining security, resilience, and compliance. Language agnostic with a focus on Spring, golang, and .NET
<br>
*Path-To-Production* - Utilized Value Stream Mapping to understand what customers end-to-end path to production would be. Identified where CI/CD automation could be utilized to reduce waste and improve time to market.
<br>
*Multi-Cloud Strategy* - Enabled customers across both public and private clouds to build and running Pivotal Application Service (Cloud Foundry) and Pivotal Container Service (Kubernetes). Optimized customers time to market by enabling the business to focus on value add tasks rather than cloud challenges.
